# KiCAD-555-timer-PCB
This project features the schematic and PCB design of a classic 555 Timer circuit, created using KiCad. The design demonstrates the use of the 555 Timer IC in astable mode, generating continuous square wave pulses for timing, blinking, or clock applications.

The project includes the complete KiCad files, Gerber outputs, and Bill of Materials (BOM), making it ready for PCB fabrication and assembly. Each component has been carefully selected for reliability and ease of prototyping, ensuring a compact and efficient circuit design.
